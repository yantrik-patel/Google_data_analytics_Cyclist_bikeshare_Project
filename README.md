# Google_data_analytics_Cyclist_bikeshare_Project
This is the Google Capstone project I did for my Google professional Data Analytics certification.
Although I am familiar with Python, I challenged myself to use R programming language for this project. All the data cleaninng, processing and visualization is done on R.
I have taken data for the year 2019 as it is having quite good number of records we can say it is a Big Dataset.
We have performed basic EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) on this data set and tried to draw out insights from it.
